# Fake News classification 
Right now, we live in a world of misinformation and fake news. The goal of this hands-on project is to detect fake news based on Recurrent Neural Networks.

Natural Language Processors (NLP) work by converting words (text) into numbers.

These numbers are then used to train an AI/ML model to make predictions.

An AI/ML-based fake news detector is crucial for companies and media to automatically predict whether circulating news is fake or not.

In this case study, we will analyze thousands of news texts to detect if it is fake or not.
